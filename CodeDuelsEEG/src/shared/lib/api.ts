// Remove all code related to AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_EMAILS, AUTHORIZED_PREMIUM_EMAILS,
// allUserProfiles, premiumPayments, localStorage usage, and the associated functions.
// This file should likely be empty or only contain truly generic API utility functions
// after this cleanup, as most logic belongs in AuthContext or Cloud Functions.

// Keep only function signatures if they are exported and might be used elsewhere,
// but remove their implementation if it relies on the removed data.
// Or, if the functions are fully redundant with AuthContext, remove them entirely.

// Example: Keep generic utils if present and safe.

// --- Start of file --- (Assuming no safe, generic utils to keep)

// (File becomes empty or contains only safe, generic utils)

// --- End of file ---
